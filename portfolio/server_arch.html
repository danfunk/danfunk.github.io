  <h3>Project Description</h3>
  <p>System Administrators are people too.</p>
  <p>All too often we throw hardware and
    bandwidth at our problems.  And while this can solve issues it must
    necessarily add complexity.  Understanding how a new application is deployed
    on the hardware can help facilitate better, more informed discussions.  It can help 
    justify decisions that might cost more money initially, but could greatly reduce 
    system complexity over time.</p>

    The diagram to the left describes a typical deployment stack in a software development
    firm.  Late breaking code is deployed to an integration environment, where it
    is tested in the context of other running systems.  Code is then deployed to a 
    staging environment where stakeholders and QA can review changes.  Finally code is
    deployed into production where it is accessible by the full customer base.

  <div class="acctitle">What were the Benefits?</div>  
  
  <div class="acc_content clearfix"> 
    Developers and System Administrators were having a hard time explaining why adding
    a new tier to the existing infrastructure would be difficult and expensive to maintain.
    This diagram helped leadership better understand the rigors involved in maintaining 
    a fifth "tier" and eventually helped establish a compromise between departments that
    resulted in a healthier organization.
