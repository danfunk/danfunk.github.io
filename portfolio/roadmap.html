  <h3>Project Description</h3>
  Successful software development is not an isolated exercise.  Coordination between
  teams of software developers, content developers, data scientists, quality control,
  and customer support is absolutely critical.  

  Diagrams like these help communicate an agile software teams long term objectives
  in a way that helps other managers anticipate periods of change and high activity.

  <div class="acctitle">What we Did?</div>
  <div class="acc_content clearfix">We developed this diagram for an organization that
  was driven by software development, but which spanned a large number of other disciplines.
  It was critical to communicate a sense of <em>cadence</em> in the development process, in order
  to give other teams a predictable work cycle.</div>
  <div class="acctitle">Benefits?</div>  
  <div class="acc_content clearfix">Establishing a visual connection between major deliverables
  and the cadence of the agile software cycle allowed managers from other teams to walk away
  with confidence in the predictability of this team.  This greatly enhanced trust between the
  teams and helped develop a much healthier working relationship.</div>
