  <h3>Project Description</h3>
    All too often we get trapped in an unhealthy spiral, attacking the same 
    problem in the same way over and over again. Sometimes we need an outside influence,
    a fresh external examination of the problem that provides a new way of seeing and
    discussing the issues.

  <div class="acc_content clearfix"> 
      A company was struggling over proposed solutions to deal
      with an online gaming platform.  Invitations to play a game were not received in
      a timely fashion.  This issue was impacting everyone from content development
      to infrastructure and IT.  No two people saw the problem 
      in the same way.  For this reason solutions were disjoint rather than collaborative.  
      This diagram helped cement
      a fresh approach on the issue and allowed tighter partnership between business
      development, data anyalytics, software development and system administration.

  <div class="acc_content clearfix">Pitching this fresh idea took time and effort within
  the company.  This diagram grew and adjusted over time, evolving based on feedback from
    a broad spectrum of concerned individuals.  As departments saw the diagram adjust to address
    their specific concerns, support for the idea grew.  This eventually spurred a massive overhaul
    of the invitation system.
