  <h3>Project Description</h3>
  The most critical areas of documentation are the junctions where disparate
  systems meet.  Diagrams can help tremendously in conveying many of the
  underlying assumptions that exist within a body of work. Not only is it 
  critical to get these APIs right, it is also critical to communicate 
  WHY they are right. </div>

  <div class="acctitle">What we Did?</div>
  <div class="acc_content clearfix"> 
  We developed a central API that would be used by a wide variety of development teams throughout the
  a mid-sized government organization.  The principle of HATEOAS (Hypertext as the Engine of Application State)
  is a cornerstone concept in REST based APIs, but it isn't an immediately intuitive.  We developed
  this diagram to help show that by requesting information about one thing, you would be provided with Links
  that could be followed to access other items.
  </div>
  <div class="acctitle">Who benefited?</div>  
  <div class="acc_content clearfix"> 
    The HATEOAS principal does an amazing job of moving business logic out of the client (user interface) code
    keeping it the server side application.  This makes for a very robust application that can more easily
    grow and adapt, thus reducing dependencies between components.
    This diagram helps teams understand and take advantage of this critical principle.  While the API allows
    for the use of these links between components, it is possible to ignore them, and hard-wire connections
    from the User interface to the API.
