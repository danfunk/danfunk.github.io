  <h3>Project Description</h3>
  Before you build, you must know the lay of the land.  Early maps often focused on dangers and threats, providing travels a means of navigating forests and rivers with relative safety.  Having a diagram to guide discussions and on-board new people can be critical to establishing a shared understanding of your infrastructure.

  <div class="acctitle">What we Did?</div>
  <div class="acc_content clearfix">We created this diagram for a company working hard to migrate their large client base into an online community.  There were many threats to making this move successful.  Providing a map that clearly indicated where threats existed, helped reduce fears and direct attention where and when it was needed.</div>
  <div class="acctitle">How much did it cost?</div>  
  <div class="acc_content clearfix"> System reviews can take four to six weeks to complete, but the time varies significantly based on the size and complexity of the system being mapped.  Charge is negotiated based on a fixed hourly rate and a cap on time.  Diagrams are provided for regular review throughout their development.</div>
